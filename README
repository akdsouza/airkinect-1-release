	2) Get/Set of camera angle is not possible
	3) Not possible to reconnect after disconnection

---- November 22, 2011: Version 1 and initial checkin.

Version 1 of the AIRKinect Native Extension includes:
	1) Depth Video
	2) RGB Video
	3) Multiple Skeletons with 20 joint positions
	4) Depth point mapping
	5) RGB and Depth resolution customization
	6) Get/Set of camera angle
	7) Translation of joint points to virtual points
	8) Transform smoothing parameters for Kinect
	9) Kinect status with connect/disconnect

Notes:
With depth video at 320x340 and rgb video at 640x480, you should recieve updates at 30fps at stable for depth,rgb, and skeleton.
As the resolution increases the frames with decrease. Because the extension runs at 30fps, it is suggestable to increase the application fps to 30fps or above for best performance.
